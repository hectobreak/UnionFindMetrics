To run the same experiments as I did:
1. Download the src folder, the .sh scripts and the .R script.
2. Create the folders bin, instances, data and plots.
3. Run the following scripts in this exact same order:
./compile.sh
./generate_instances.sh
./get_data.sh
./get_times.sh
4. Open visualization.R on RStudio
5. Set the R work environment to this exact same folder
6. Run the R script
